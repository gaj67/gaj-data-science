    "Australian Rules Football is a game played between two opposing teams, say team A and team B. Each match takes place over four quarters, with each quarter having approximately 30 minutes duration. During each quarter, team A attempts to kick or hand-pass the football towards their scoring end of the oval, and team B attempts to send the ball to the opposite end of the oval. The scoring ends swap after each quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring area consists of four (almost) equally spaced posts, forming the \"goal\" area between the inner two posts (the goal posts) and two \"behind\" areas between the outer two posts (the behind posts) and the inner two posts. If the football is kicked between the goal posts (without touching either post), then the scoring team scores a goal worth 6 points.\n",
    "If the ball is kicked between a behind post and a goal post (without touching), then the scoring team scores a behind worth 1 point. If the ball touches or hits a goal post, then this scores as a behind. If the ball touches or hits a behind post, then this results in an \"out-of-bounds\" free (penalty kick-out) for the opposing team, with no change in score. If the ball is touched by hand (by either team) before going in for a goal, then this is also regarded as a behind. There are further rules regarding whether team B 'scoring' in team A's area results in a behind or a free for team A.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the fourth quarter, i.e. at the end of the match, if team A and team B have the same point scores, then the match is a draw (worth 2 match points to each team). Otherwise, the team with the most points wins (gaining 4 match points), and the opposing team loses (gaining 0 match points). We shall sometimes refer to a non-drawn game as having an *outright* or *definite* result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week during the football season, known as a \"round\", pairs of teams (within the same league, obviously) play matches. At the end of each round, all teams are ranked on the league ladder by match points. Ties are broken based on the accumulated number of points scored for (i.e. by) and against each team. At the end of the so-called \"minor\" rounds, the teams in the top-half of the ladder go into the \"finals\" rounds. Ultimately, only two teams oppose each other in the grand final match of the season, with the winning team becoming the season champions."

    "Unlike many other sporting games, Australian Rules Football may validly result in a draw between the two teams competing in any given match. However, since draws historically account for fewer than 1% of match outcomes, they are clearly very difficult to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, a draw is somewhat anomalous in that it could have been avoided if the circumstances of an actual drawn match had been slightly different. One can imagine, for example, a situation in which a ball that bounced awkwardly into the goal had instead bounced the other way (resulting in no score), or if a ball that hit the goal post (thereby scoring only a behind) had instead sailed between the posts (scoring a goal). Alternative realities aside, a draw, i.e. a zero difference between the scores of the two teams at the end of a match, is essentially an unstable equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, although we need to account for draws, how do we deal with them in the data? One approach is to regard a draw as both a win and a loss for each team. Indeed, although an outright result gives the winning team 4 match points (with 0 match points given to the losing team), for a draw both teams gain 2 match points (i.e. half each). Hence, we could\n",
    "regard a draw between team A and team B as both a win for team A and a win for team B, but weighted at 0.5 each (so that the total number of matches is not altered in the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to simply discard draws, which will have little effect since they only account for 1% of the data. However, we do not recommend discarding data within any given season (although we will discard entire seasons). For instance, removing draws from the dataset would make it impossible to correctly compute the number of match points for each team in the league ranking. Additionally, neglecting draws would lose relevant information, namely that a draw between teams A and B indicates that those teams were\n",
